    <h1 id="Red_panda">The Red Panda</h1>
    <p>The red panda is a small, tree-dwelling mammal native to the eastern Himalayas and southwestern China.
        Despite its name, <strong>the red panda is not closely related to the giant panda</strong>. It has reddish-brown
        fur,
        a long bushy tail, and a waddling gait due to its shorter front legs. <em>Red pandas are primarily
            herbivores</em>,
        feeding on bamboo, but they also eat fruits, acorns, and insects. Known for their agility, they use their
        sharp claws to climb trees and escape predators. Unfortunately, red pandas are classified as endangered due to
        habitat loss and poaching.
